// My implementation of binary search algorithm.
// Although this is an exercise from the ARMLITE book by Richard Pawson and Peter Higginson, I have decided to not look at the example in the book for guidiance. Instead, I am researching binary search algorithm. As well as attempting to understand and implement the pseudocode in assembly language. The resource I am using right now is wikipedia. 
// It is also worth noting that I am writing this by the hospital bed of my dad. He had a brain surgery.

// IDEA FOR THE ALGORITHM: 
// * there would be a middle index, lower index, and upper index
// * At each point in time, middle index = (lower index + upper index) / 2
