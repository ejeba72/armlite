// Nigerian flag
/*
DIMENSIONS (Drawing or sketch could help):
- the flag has a rectangular shape which has 4 corners: (A) UPPER_LEFT_CORNER, (B) UPPER_RIGHT_CORNER, (C) LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER, (D) LOWER_LEFT_CORNER.
- width: should be 3/4 of the width of the screen == 3/4*64 == 48 pixels == 48*4 bit == 192 bit
- height: should be 2/3 of the height of the screen == 2/3*48 == 32 pixels == 32*4 bit == 128 bit
- However, I would like the flag to be at the center of the screen.
- starting position: let pixel origin be #.PixelScreen. Flag starting point, which is the UPPER_LEFT_CORNER, is 8 pixels east of pixel origin and 4 pixels south of pixel origin (I will just use east or south hence forth, instead of east of pixel origin and such).
- In other words, 
- HORIZONTAL_OFFSET (of UPPER_LEFT_CORNER) == 8 pixels == 8*4 bit == 32 bit
- VERTICAL_OFFSET (of UPPER_LEFT_CORNER) == 4 pixel == 4*4 == 16 bit
- green-white-green sections: 1/3*48 == 16 pixels for each section == 16 * 4 bits == 64 bits
- the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER on the flag == (8+48) pixels east of the pixel origin and (4+32) pixels south of the pixel origin == 56 by 36 pixels == you would have to count 35 horizontal lines of pixels (64 pixels or 256 bits per line) from top to bottom (southward), and on the 36th line, you would count 56 pixel (56 * 4 bits) from left to right (eastward) == (35*256 bit) + (56*4 bit) == 9184 bits
- since the width of each section is 64 bits, we can locate or map the pixel at the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of each section.
- first of all, the LOWER_LEFT_CORNER of the entire flag == (((VERTICAL_OFFSET + height of the flag) - 1) * a line of pixel) + HORIZONTAL_OFFSET == (((4 pixel + 32 pixel) - 1 pixel) * 256 bit per line) + 32 bits == 8992 bit
- the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 1st section == 64 bit + LOWER_LEFT_CORNER of the entire flag == 64+8992 bit == 9056 bit
- the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 2nd section == 64 bit + LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 1st section == 64+9056 bit == 9120 bit
- the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 3rd section == 64 bit + LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 2nd section == 64+9120 == 9184 bit
- I imagine that the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the flag should be equal to the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 3rd section of the flag. The results confirms this.

1ST ITERATION (simplest approach):
- let the flag starting point be at the pixel origin.
- create the 1st line of the 1st section of the flag == 48pixel รท 3 == 16pixel == 16 * 4 == 64 bits.

3RD ITERATION
- since in this case the flag's starting point is exactly at the pixel origin, the last point on the flag == 48 pixels east of the pixel origin and 32 pixels south of the pixel origin == 48 by 32 pixels == you would have to count 31 horizontal lines of pixels (64 pixels or 256 bits per line) from top to bottom (southward), and on the 32nd line, you would count 48 pixels (48 * 4 bits) from left to right (eastward) == (31*256 bit) + (48*4 bit) ==  8128 bits
- INITIAL_STARTING_POINT == UPPER_LEFT_CORNER of flag == r2 = 0
- NEXT_PIXEL == add r2, r2, #4
- NEXT_LINE_OF_PIXELS == add r2, r2, #192  (width of the screen - width of a section == 256-64 == 192 bits)
- ENDING_POINT of 1st section == the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 1st section == 9056 bit

- STARTING_POINT of 2nd section == WIDTH_OF_SECTION + 4 bits + HORIZONTAL_OFFSET + EFFECT_OF_VERTICAL_OFFSET == (16 * 4) + 4 + 0 + 0 = 68 bits
- ENDING_POINT OF 2nd section == the LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of the 2nd section == 9120 bits

- the mathematical or absolute difference between the STARTING_POINT of 2nd section and the ENDING_POINT of 2nd section == | 68 - 9120 | == 9052

- NEXT_SECTION_OF_FLAG == manually assign the value of a section's starting point.
- FINAL_ENDING_POINT == LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER of flag == r... = ...

- STOP ALL THIS TOO MANY GEOMETRIC CALCULATIONS!!! All you need to know are the starting points of each section. And the number of horizontal lines of pixels you wish to have. Then use an incrementer and compare operators to determine the number of lines you wish to color.
